(3 knocks) Penny! (3 knocks) Penny! (3 knocks) Penny!
What happens if I say come in?
Well, find out.
Come in!
(3 knocks) Bernadette! (3 knocks) Bernadette! (3 knocks) Bernadette!
Come in!
Keep it up. I've got nowhere else to be.
Just come in.
For future reference, if I want to watch Mean Girls, I'll just stream it on Netflix.
You'll never guess what just happened.
You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an inter-dimensional portal, which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you're back, to bring us all with you to the year 7010, where we are transported to work at the think-a-torium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins? 
No.
Awww.
Who would ever guess that?
I'm exceedingly smart. I graduated college at fourteen. While my brother was getting an STD, I was getting a Ph.D. Penicillin can't take this away.
Oh, I should probably tell you something about this gift.
You mean, before you give it to me?
Yes. But may I ask you a question before I give it to you?
Of course.
Why are we saying give it to you like that?
I'd like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement, specifically to address Penny's annoying personal habits.
Oh my God! What personal habits?
I have a list. FYI overuse of the phrase "Oh my God" is number 12.
Thankfully all the things my girlfriend used to do can be taken care of with my right hand.
I did a bad thing.
Does it affect me?
No.
Then suffer in silence.
Our babies will be smart and beautiful. 
Not to mention imaginary.
May I say something?
Not right now, dude.
But I think it may be comforting.
Buddy-
No, it's okay. What?
When I lost my own father, I didn't have any friends to help me through it. You do.
don't take this the wrong way, but, you're insane. 
That may well be, but the fact is it wouldn't kill us to meet some new people. 
For the record, it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers or the carriers of unusual pathogens. And I'm not insane, my mother had me tested.
Why are you crying? 
Because I'm stupid. 
That's no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid, and that makes me sad.
Scissors cuts paper.
paper covers rock.
rock crushes lizard
lizard poisons Spock.
Spock smashes scissors.
scissors decapitates lizard.
lizard eats paper.
paper disproves Spock.
Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.
I don't like bugs, okay. They freak me out.
Interesting. You're afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic.
You might not want to ditch her on her birthday.
I think you has a point. You can see it another day.
But someone might spoil the movie. No one can spoil a birthday for me. Surprise, we are even older. Who saw that coming?
Aww, that's nice. Put that on a cake.
Oh, big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun.
"Not knowing is part of the fun." Was that the motto of your community college?
The correct animal for inter-species super soldier is the koala. You would wind up with an army so cute, it couldn't be attacked.
Um, that's where I sit.
So, sit next to me.
No, I sit there.
What's the difference?
"What's the difference"?
Here we go.
In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. I
n the summer it's directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows, there and there. 
It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion. 
I could go on, but I think I've made my point.
I made tea. 
I don't want tea. 
I didn't make tea for you. This is my tea. 
Then why are you telling me? 
It's a conversation starter. 
That's a lousy conversation starter. 
Oh, is it? We're conversing. Checkmate.
